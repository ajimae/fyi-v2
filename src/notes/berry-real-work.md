### The Real Work, by Wendell Berry

It may be that when we no longer know what to do
we have come our real work,

and that when we no longer know which way to go
we have come to our real journey.

The mind that is not baffled is not employed.

The impeded stream is the one that sings.

I have a lot of love for this poem, which in the span of less than 10 lines at once expresses a universal feeling of 'loss of direction', or desire for a sense of purpose, and simultaneously acts as words of encouragement and a love letter to nature.

The impeded stream is the one that sings.
