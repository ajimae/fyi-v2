I'm living in Taiwan.

I just recently quit my job as the solo developer at a sports start-up to focus on more personally fulfilling work.

Recently I've been working on some personal projects. Besides learning 11ty through building this website, also having fun building some personal automations with iOS Shortcuts, Bash scripts, and Github Workflows. I also have a serverless project in the works but I'll only talk more about that when I'm done.

Watching with great interest the Epic v. Apple debate. 

Music-wise, currently obsessed with Mary Lattimore's space-y ambient harp.
