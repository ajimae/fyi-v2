I'm living in Taiwan.

I just recently quit my job as the solo developer at a sports start-up to focus on more personally fulfilling work.

Recently I've been working on some personal projects. Getting familiar with 11ty through building this website, having fun building some personal automations with iOS Shortcuts, Bash scripts, and Github Workflows. Exploring my creative side with p5JS. I also have a serverless project in the works but I'll talk more about that when I'm done.
