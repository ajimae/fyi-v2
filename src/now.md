I'm living in Taiwan.

I just recently quit my job as the solo developer at a sports start-up to focus on more personally fulfilling work.

I've been focusing on personal projects. Getting familiar with 11ty through iterating on this website, building some personal automations with iOS Shortcuts, Bash scripts, and Github Workflows. Exploring my creative side with p5js. 

Currently writing a blog post on how to set up a serverless project to connect with a relational database, which is something I'm doing in a side project I'm excited about.

* Reading: [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism) and [Mythologies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51715.Mythologies?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=6mxSC7MCZ9&rank=1), a collection of short essays by Roland Barthes.
